The level of customization is not quite up to the levels of Nova Launcher with a simple AOSP or Pixel Launcher-like approach taken here.‚Äù -Damien Wilde@9to5Google</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>¬†This is a very odd way for a company to release a software product; and although I appreciate the sentiment of being in ties with the community, this is not on par with community &amp; enthusiast style customization. The only major distinct feature of this vs the pixel launcher would be the native icon pack support, 3 widgets, and a custom font in menus.</p>
<p>Using some <em>unorthodox</em> methods, I got it working on my s10e, and was immediately taken aback by the permanent google search bar, that does not look to be removable. It also lacks material you support, the stock widget menu looks very out of place, and the aesthetic of Nothing only works well with a black and white wallpaper and icon pack.</p>

<p>Little Signals, a DIY ambient computing kit by Google.</p>
<p>Recently, Google unveiled a project called ‚Äúlittle signals‚Äù, it is their biggest exploration into ambient computing since google assistant. Essentially, little signals are notification alerts that are designed to be as little of an intrusion into life as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is not on track to become an actual Made by Google product. (Source: 9to5Google),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there are instructions to make your own DIY little signal, with the nest aesthetic with an arruino at the website: <a href="https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/</a></p>
<p>What counts as an alert:</p>
<div id="ips_uid_4232_2" class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">
<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix">
<ul>
<li>What seems to be a notification seems to be completely different from the types of notifications you might get on your phone, the example given in the documentation and supplied code are based on the environment, with possible triggers such as weather, rainfall, temperature, and other quantifiable alerts.</li>
<li>Example (using the air little signal): the arduino pings the openweathermap.org api, and it says that it has begun raining, the air little signal sends a gust of air into the plant on top of it. You notice the plant move, and are prompted to open blinds, a phone, or more, to get more information. The end goal of this is to eliminate the need for a phone as a feed, and get all the alerts you need without thinking about it.¬†</li>
<li>Example 2 (using the movement little signal) (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my idea, and there are no official guides on making this trigger):</li>
</ul>
<p>the arduino gets the forecast for the day (not putting an api because there is none listed officially), and the pegs move to see how the temp is throughout the day. These values would be arbitrary, but combined with another trigger to see the current temperature, you can see it all at a glance, without the tech being overtly visible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Meet the objects:</p>

<p>How to build your own Little Signals:</p>
<p>You can build your own Little Signals by following the guide downloadable¬†<a href="https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/download/Experiment%20With%20Little%20Signals.zip" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here</a>, this guide requires an arduino, and has most of the objects made out of card stock, however, you can probably 3D print your own chassis for them(dont forget ventilation).</p>
<p>Impact of this project:</p>
<p>Google is showing increased interest in ambient computing, and with this being their first real project into it, it shows a glimpse into the future of the google ecosystem. My personal prediction is the eventual death of the phone as anything more than a content (games, videos, and art) creation and consuming facilitator, and work related facilities. But using the phone as a means of asking questions, checking your surroundings, and other things the google assistant can already do, will eventually fizzle away from the phone and be replaced by cues in your environment.</p>
