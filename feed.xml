                <p>Samsung has been a long lasting android device manufacturer, however, they are infamous for their slow updates and patchy support; Recently, Samsung has been fixing up their act with updates, releasing them faster, and giving more support to devices. However, the Android Twelve update could have gone much better.<br>(Disclaimer: I am using a Galaxy S10e, my views are reflective of my experiences with these updates, and the flagship devices.)</p>
<p>This story is the first ever Prism Exclusive! Please discuss in the comments.</p>
<p><br>Android 12 Beta:<br>“On September 14, 2021, the One UI 4.0 Android 12 beta went live for the Galaxy S21 series in select markets. It was gradually rolled out in all supported markets. Samsung eventually opened up the beta to the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy Note 20 series.” (Quote: <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-12-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SamMobile</a>)<br>Initially, problems seemed to arise, Icon theming didn’t extend to google apps, and the Monet palettes generated were excessively vibrant compared to their google counterparts. These problems have not yet been resolved.<br><br>Good Lock:<br>Samsung’s semi-official tweaking hub “Good Lock”, received a multitude of updates for Android 12, most notably, the ability to import custom icon packs. However, this update poses potential legal issues, as refunded icon packs stay in the Good Lock app, available for use. On the good side of Good Lock, icon packs are finally available on the stock “One UI” launcher(albeit with the Good Lock app needed to be downloaded from the Galaxy Store), volume can be adjusted on an app-by-app basis, side-swipe gestures can perform a vast multitude of actions, the recents menu can be completely redesigned; and the keyboard’s colors, animations, and sounds can all be customized. All in all, the Good Lock app really completes the One UI experience.</p>
<p>The Rollout:<br>The rollout of Android 12 and One UI 4.0 was a little shaky, but there were no major setbacks, and some devices got their update months ahead of schedule. The problem arises in the contents of the update. Kevin27 on the Samsung forum said “so I've just checked most of mine are using blue inside, which is the main color of my chosen pallette, I've found 2 using purple instead (which is one of the other 2 colors in my pallette) the Play Store is one, Google Clock app is the other - I don't know why these 2 are using purple instead of the blue.” This update left many people confused, so let’s explain what’s happening in the case of Kevin27. The One ui 4.0 theme selector shows 3 colors per Monet theme.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xs.png 300w ,https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-sm.png 480w ,https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-md.png 768w ,https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://prism.pages.dev/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="292" height="80"></figure>
<p>The palettes being shown with this little amount of description leads to people not knowing what their own pallettes even mean. The main color of Kevin’s pallette was actually supposed to be purple, but with Samsung’s poor implementation of Monet, the apps that should be themed purple were left the default android 11 blue. As to my personal experiences, a Samsung support agent had the same problems as me, and could not provide a fix on this. What happened? To be honest, I really have no clue how Samsung’s implementation didn’t affect all of the android apps, however, I have heard from developers that there are multiple ways to implement monet into apps(and that they are all very convoluted), and it looks like whatever implementation the indie devs used worked a lot better than the google implementation. </p>

<p><br><br>The solution: <br>With One UI 4.1, Samsung seemingly fixed all these issues. The real question is what was wrong? All apps that support Monet theming do work(for me, at the time of writing); but the timeline it took to get there is very bumpy. On January 15th, I received the One UI 4.0 update, and it was not until March that my phone was supposed to get 4.1. To clarify, One UI 4.1 was part of the March security patch, and it started a slow release to the s10 lineup in (reportedly) March 28th. However, that was a Switzerland only release. On April 26th, it started a US release, on Unlocked phones only(which is odd, because usually carriers release their updates faster). On April 29th, nearly two months after "March", the rest of the s10 lineup was updated to One UI 4.1. The Galaxy A21 is still in the release phase of this update, nearly two and a half months later.</p>

<p><br><br>The solution to the solution:<br>    Quite simply, Samsung has too many phones; from the A series to the Z series and S and M and W. And there are multiple phones in these lineups a year, and those phones have different models, and those different models use different carriers, and those different carriers can be in different regions that Samsung controls the updates for. The iPhone(no matter your or my opinion) is stable. With only one series a year (with the occasional SE), Apple can devote much more resources to developing good software for each device, and support them longer. If Samsung adopts a better phone tiering model, they might be able to prevent this from happening again.<br><br>Thinking about the future, Android 13 is supposed to add themed icons to all icons, (given that a developer provides a line art icon to their play store listing or apk) but Samsung’s themed icon aesthetic is not the same as Google’s; these clashing ideas may lead to a very poorly implemented design language in the future. Samsung claims to be supporting their new phones for even longer times, but until they clean up their act, this is bound to happen again.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>
<p> This is a very odd way for a company to release a software product; and although I appreciate the sentiment of being in ties with the community, this is not on par with community &amp; enthusiast style customization. The only major distinct feature of this vs the pixel launcher would be the native icon pack support, 3 widgets, and a custom font in menus.</p>
<p>Using some <em>unorthodox</em> methods, I got it working on my s10e, and was immediately taken aback by the permanent google search bar, that does not look to be removable. It also lacks material you support, the stock widget menu looks very out of place, and the aesthetic of Nothing only works well with a black and white wallpaper and icon pack.</p>

<p>Little Signals, a DIY ambient computing kit by Google.</p>
<p>Recently, Google unveiled a project called “little signals”, it is their biggest exploration into ambient computing since google assistant. Essentially, little signals are notification alerts that are designed to be as little of an intrusion into life as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is not on track to become an actual Made by Google product. (Source: 9to5Google),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there are instructions to make your own DIY little signal, with the nest aesthetic with an arruino at the website: <a href="https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/</a></p>
<p>What counts as an alert:</p>
<div id="ips_uid_4232_2" class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">
<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix">
<ul>
<li>What seems to be a notification seems to be completely different from the types of notifications you might get on your phone, the example given in the documentation and supplied code are based on the environment, with possible triggers such as weather, rainfall, temperature, and other quantifiable alerts.</li>
<li>Example (using the air little signal): the arduino pings the openweathermap.org api, and it says that it has begun raining, the air little signal sends a gust of air into the plant on top of it. You notice the plant move, and are prompted to open blinds, a phone, or more, to get more information. The end goal of this is to eliminate the need for a phone as a feed, and get all the alerts you need without thinking about it. </li>
<li>Example 2 (using the movement little signal) (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my idea, and there are no official guides on making this trigger):</li>
</ul>
<p>the arduino gets the forecast for the day (not putting an api because there is none listed officially), and the pegs move to see how the temp is throughout the day. These values would be arbitrary, but combined with another trigger to see the current temperature, you can see it all at a glance, without the tech being overtly visible.</p>

You might get varying degrees of success with a 3D printed chassis. <br><a href="https://youtu.be/XdSwhyFegF8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Video by google</a></div>

Pulses of air move nearby items, like the leaves of a plant, to attract attention.<figure class="shrinkToFit"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-button.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-button.png" width="1536" height="693"></figure><br><strong>Button</strong> combines scale and sound to communicate and provide control. The top twists – right for more details, left for less – and grows as it receives information. It plays a tone when full.<figure class="shrinkToFit"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-movement.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-movement.png" width="1536" height="693"></figure><br><strong>Movement</strong> features seven pegs that graphically represent information – like a calendar or timer– through their height and motion. The pegs work individually or as a group, and are tapped for simple input.<figure class="shrinkToFit"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-rhythm.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-rhythm.png" width="1536" height="693"></figure><br><strong>Rhythm</strong> generates ambient sounds. Qualities of the melody convey qualities of the information, like its importance, urgency, or tone. A wave over the object, or simply turning it over, mutes it.<figure class="shrinkToFit"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-shadow.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-shadow.png" width="1536" height="693"></figure><br><strong>Shadow</strong> communicates through the movements of the shadow it casts. They show the object’s status, like gently breathing when active or stretching in response to presence.<figure class="shrinkToFit"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-tap.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-tap.png" width="1536" height="693"></figure><br><strong>Tap</strong> makes use of surfaces to create sounds that act as notifications.

<p>How to build your own Little Signals:</p>
<p>You can build your own Little Signals by following the guide downloadable <a href="https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/download/Experiment%20With%20Little%20Signals.zip" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here</a>, this guide requires an arduino, and has most of the objects made out of card stock, however, you can probably 3D print your own chassis for them(dont forget ventilation).</p>
<p>Impact of this project:</p>
<p>Google is showing increased interest in ambient computing, and with this being their first real project into it, it shows a glimpse into the future of the google ecosystem. My personal prediction is the eventual death of the phone as anything more than a content (games, videos, and art) creation and consuming facilitator, and work related facilities. But using the phone as a means of asking questions, checking your surroundings, and other things the google assistant can already do, will eventually fizzle away from the phone and be replaced by cues in your environment.</p>
