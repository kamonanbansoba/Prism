However, the Android Twelve update could have gone much better.<br>(Disclaimer: I am using a Galaxy S10e, my views are reflective of my experiences with these updates, and the flagship devices.)</p>\n<p>This story is the first ever Prism Exclusive! Please discuss in the comments.</p>\n<p><br>Android 12 Beta:<br>“On September 14, 2021, the One UI 4.0 Android 12 beta went live for the Galaxy S21 series in select markets. It was gradually rolled out in all supported markets. Samsung eventually opened up the beta to the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy Note 20 series.” (Quote: <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-12-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SamMobile</a>)<br>Initially, problems seemed to arise, Icon theming didn’t extend to google apps, and the Monet palettes generated were excessively vibrant compared to their google counterparts. These problems have not yet been resolved.<br><br>Good Lock:<br>Samsung’s semi-official tweaking hub “Good Lock”, received a multitude of updates for Android 12, most notably, the ability to import custom icon packs. However, this update poses potential legal issues, as refunded icon packs stay in the Good Lock app, available for use. On the good side of Good Lock, icon packs are finally available on the stock “One UI” launcher(albeit with the Good Lock app needed to be downloaded from the Galaxy Store), volume can be adjusted on an app-by-app basis, side-swipe gestures can perform a vast multitude of actions, the recents menu can be completely redesigned; and the keyboard’s colors, animations, and sounds can all be customized. All in all, the Good Lock app really completes the One UI experience.</p>\n<p>The Rollout:<br>The rollout of Android 12 and One UI 4.0 was a little shaky, but there were no major setbacks, and some devices got their update months ahead of schedule. The problem arises in the contents of the update. Kevin27 on the Samsung forum said “so I've just checked most of mine are using blue inside, which is the main color of my chosen pallette, I've found 2 using purple instead (which is one of the other 2 colors in my pallette) the Play Store is one, Google Clock app is the other - I don't know why these 2 are using purple instead of the blue.” This update left many people confused, so let’s explain what’s happening in the case of Kevin27. The One ui 4.0 theme selector shows 3 colors per Monet theme.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xs.png 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-sm.png 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-md.png 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"80\"></figure>\n<p>The palettes being shown with this little amount of description leads to people not knowing what their own pallettes even mean. The main color of Kevin’s pallette was actually supposed to be purple, but with Samsung’s poor implementation of Monet, the apps that should be themed purple were left the default android 11 blue. As to my personal experiences, a Samsung support agent had the same problems as me, and could not provide a fix on this. What happened? To be honest, I really have no clue how Samsung’s implementation didn’t affect all of the android apps, however, I have heard from developers that there are multiple ways to implement monet into apps(and that they are all very convoluted), and it looks like whatever implementation the indie devs used worked a lot better than the Google implementation. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-xs.jpg 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-sm.jpg 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-md.jpg 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"A samsung support member reproducing the issue\" width=\"1080\" height=\"2280\"></figure>\n<p><br><br>The solution: <br>With One UI 4.1, Samsung seemingly fixed all these issues. The real question is what was wrong? All apps that support Monet theming do work(for me, at the time of writing); but the timeline it took to get there is very bumpy. On January 15th, I received the One UI 4.0 update, and it was not until March that my phone was supposed to get 4.1. To clarify, One UI 4.1 was part of the March security patch, and it started a slow release to the s10 lineup in (reportedly) March 28th. However, that was a Switzerland only release. On April 26th, it started a US release, on Unlocked phones only(which is odd, because usually carriers release their updates faster). On April 29th, nearly two months after \"March\", the rest of the s10 lineup was updated to One UI 4.1. The Galaxy A21 is still in the release phase of this update, nearly two and a half months later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-xs.jpg 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-sm.jpg 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-md.jpg 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"2280\"></figure>\n<p><br><br>The solution to the solution:<br>    Quite simply, Samsung has too many phones; from the A series to the Z series and S and M and W. And there are multiple phones in these lineups a year, and those phones have different models, and those different models use different carriers, and those different carriers can be in different regions that Samsung controls the updates for. The iPhone(no matter your or my opinion) is stable. With only one series a year (with the occasional SE), Apple can devote much more resources to developing good software for each device, and support them longer. If Samsung adopts a better phone tiering model, they might be able to prevent this from happening again.<br><br>Thinking about the future, Android 13 is supposed to add themed icons to all icons, (given that a developer provides a line art icon to their play store listing or apk) but Samsung’s themed icon aesthetic is not the same as Google’s; these clashing ideas may lead to a very poorly implemented design language in the future. Samsung claims to be supporting their new phones for even longer times, but until they clean up their act, this is bound to happen again.</p>",

The end goal of this is to eliminate the need for a phone as a feed, and get all the alerts you need without thinking about it. </li>\n<li>Example 2 (using the movement little signal) (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my idea, and there are no official guides on making this trigger):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the arduino gets the forecast for the day (not putting an api because there is none listed officially), and the pegs move to see how the temp is throughout the day. These values would be arbitrary, but combined with another trigger to see the current temperature, you can see it all at a glance, without the tech being overtly visible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Meet the objects:</p>\n<div id=\"ips_uid_4232_3\" class=\"ipsSpoiler\" data-ipsspoiler=\"\">\n<div class=\"ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix\">Disclaimer: these are google’s unofficial mockups, the ones provided by their schematics are made with card stock.

My personal prediction is the eventual death of the phone as anything more than a content (games, videos, and art) creation and consuming facilitator, and work related facilities. But using the phone as a means of asking questions, checking your surroundings, and other things the google assistant can already do, will eventually fizzle away from the phone and be replaced by cues in your environment.</p>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/14/google-little-signals-experiment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9to5Google</a> for transcriptions of the google website &amp; quotes</p>\n</div>",
