You notice the plant move, and are prompted to open blinds, a phone, or more, to get more information. The end goal of this is to eliminate the need for a phone as a feed, and get all the alerts you need without thinking about it.¬†</li>\n<li>Example 2 (using the movement little signal) (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my idea, and there are no official guides on making this trigger):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the arduino gets the forecast for the day (not putting an api because there is none listed officially), and the pegs move to see how the temp is throughout the day.

My personal prediction is the eventual death of the phone as anything more than a content (games, videos, and art) creation and consuming facilitator, and work related facilities. But using the phone as a means of asking questions, checking your surroundings, and other things the google assistant can already do, will eventually fizzle away from the phone and be replaced by cues in your environment.</p>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/14/google-little-signals-experiment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9to5Google</a> for transcriptions of the google website &amp; quotes</p>\n</div>",
