They lost almost 2 million dollars because they didn't fix the ice-cream machine last year (Jargon, Wall Street Journal). With this amount of money at stake, it would be bold to assume that McDonalds' employees are just too lazy to fix the machine, and it turns out that some franchises are held back from making repairs on the machines that you would think they own. It has been common practice in the past few decades for manufacturers to impose restrictions on the products you purchase, so you keep coming back after the initial transaction. This is why consumers need to lobby for legislation holding manufacturers more accountable for making sure that consumers can repair, upgrade, recycle, and use the products that they bought to their fullest extent.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-xs.png 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-sm.png 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-md.png 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-lg.png 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-xl.png 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/13/responsive/librewolf_QOlb9ft1SM-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1363\" height=\"708\">\n<figcaption >McBroken</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some corporations think that the right to repair is bad for consumers, Apple thinks that right to repair, along with being able to tamper with your device, will lead to hackers being easily able to take control of devices (Vice.com). John Deere makes the point that if farmers have the ability to control their tractors, they could tamper with emission settings, break EPA laws, and cause irreversible damage to the environment (Chase, AgriPulse). In general, an uneducated consumer that has the power to tamper with their products can tarnish both the product and the image of the brand that made it. If the manufacturer has full control over what you can and can not do with your product, they can tailor the experience to how they think it is best.</span></p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/John_Deere_3020_Diesel%2C_repair.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Dwight Sipler\" width=\"3872\" height=\"2592\"></figure>\n<figcaption ><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://flickr.com/people/62528187@N00\">Dwight Sipler</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes sense from that point of view, the job of the company is to maintain their image, and most of all, make money. The reason the right to repair loses companies money is because of their current models. Taylor, the company that sources McDonalds their ice-cream machines, does not let franchises diagnose their machines “McDonald's emailed the owners of all 13,000 franchises. According to O'Sullivan, \"They said, 'Don't use Kytch.'\" (Stevens, CBS)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third party company called \"Kytch\" seeked to give employees a way to diagnose their machines, however, using these machines was highly discouraged by corporate McDonalds, because business partner Taylor makes 25% of their income from diagnostic and repair (Stevens, CBS). Apple's scheme is to phase out old devices, so you purchase a new one. To be clear, Apple is not the only phone manufacturer to engage in this \"planned-obsolescence\", they are just well documented.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"n3VNCb KAlRDb\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/607f51fec42707093e4968a0/master/w_2000,h_1333,c_limit/web2_2021_04_06_Kytch_14153.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"They Hacked McDonald's Ice Cream Machines—and Started a Cold War | WIRED\" data-noaft=\"1\"></figure>\n<figcaption >WIRED</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is quite simple, consumers need to lobby for legislation forcing companies to make repairable and sustainable products. There are 4 key aspects to making a sustainable product: documentation, ownership, repairability, and environmental consciousness. The statement of right to repair being harmful to a company's reputation due to a faulty repair process is refuted by making documentation and parts accessible; if official instructions and parts are accessible, the chance that enthusiasts will mess up a repair is significantly decreased. And if an average user encounters an issue, then it is easier for a local repair shop to fix the issue. Many times, a consumer thinks that they own the products that they purchased, however, warranties and support keep the product that you purchased safe; if an unauthorized repair shop fixes an iPhone, the warranty is voided, and it can't be disposed of safely via their e-waste program; With official documentation, manufacturers need to take responsibility for faulty products or repair instructions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturers need to provide parts to make repairs, or a service for the same or a lower cost than the parts required for the repair; with official parts available, the chance of a user purchasing a faulty replacement dramatically drops; and a service that gives fair prices for repairing a product will help a user that would appreciate not taking the risk of self-service repair to keep using their device as intended. Apple and many other companies such as Google, Tesla, and H&amp;M claim to be conscious about the environment; Apple removed the charger and plastic wrap from iPhone boxes to reduce waste, however, when they replace a whole phone as opposed to the broken part (Rossmann, YouTube), they are causing waste in terms of shipping a heavier item, replacing the whole phone, and promoting labor in countries with bad ethics, labor laws, and environmental impact (Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre), all to disassemble the phone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple has bad practices, though it is important to realize that they are trying to make an effort to fix them, one example being the self service repair store. Using </span><a href=\"https://www.selfservicerepair.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selfservicerepair</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a user can order genuine Apple parts, and tools, and repair manuals are available for free. While this may sound good, the implementation lacks a lot of important steps to make the product fully repairable. The first of this being the fact that the repairs made with genuine apple parts and manuals aren’t even covered under warranty, which means that the user would still have to fork over a lot of money for an official repair. For example, just to use the official tools, a user has to pay thousands in collateral “It involved first placing a $1,210 hold on my credit card to rent 75 pounds of repair equipment, which arrived at my door in hard plastic cases. The process was then so unforgiving that I destroyed my iPhone screen in a split second with an irreversible error.”(Chen, New York Times), and a repair costs just $10 less than an official one under warranty. Documentation may sound nice, but apple advises </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the iPhone has any of the following conditions, stop the repair:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There’s no glass or insufficient glass for the protective cover to adhere to.[…]”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which means that if a user really needs to repair their device, they have to send it in for a premium price, for someone else to do it for them. </span></p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

this? An example of a company that has their repair policy figured out is Patagonia; using the repair checklist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documentation: Patagonia offers DIY repair guides and materials for most types of basic clothing repair, and performing a repair yourself doesn’t void their extremely good warranty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ownership: Patagonia offers an “IronClad guarantee” that covers repair of your products for almost their entire life cycle, it is not free, but a large gash on a jacket 5 years in to one user’s life cycle was deemed unrepairable by Patagonia, and they reimbursed the user for just $30 less than the retail price of that product (TheDataDispatch, YouTube). Once a user no longer wants to use their Patagonia™ product, they can donate it to </span><a href=\"http://www.wornwear.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wornwear.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for up to $100 (WornWear). They encourage owning a product for a long time with timeless design and repairability, as opposed to the fast fashion trends that might seem cheap in the short term, but end up costing  the user and the planet in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repairability: Patagonia products are very repairable, and they provide products to complete the repairs yourself. Repairs also don’t void your warranty!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Environmental Consciousness: Patagonia was a founding member of “1% for the planet”, a non-profit organization that donates 1% of a company’s profits to charities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare that to Apple and Tesla, who both are against right to repair. They both just started offering repair documentation for free this year via self service repair.com and service.tesla.com (INSIDEEVS). However, they threaten voiding the user’s warranty if they try to repair it without an unauthorized repair shop, or by themselves. Apple’s self service repair program helps give users official parts, but without the warranty support, it doesn’t matter; and Tesla doesn’t provide any official replacement engine or drivetrain parts to normal users. While both companies claim to do good for the environment, they could do so much more, Apple and Tesla both use proprietary chargers even though there is an industry standard; this means that more waste is created making different charging stations and cables for both of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In practice, both of these stances do benefit the consumer; just in different ways. A company would like to keep control of the whole supply chain and repair cycle in order to give the \"best” experience to the user, and claim less legal liability. But most consumers would like to control their own experience, the truth is that no one solution will work for everyone, and the right to not only repair, but ownership and sustainable products, is better for the consumer, their wallets, and the planet. Legal action is the second best way to come about this, every consumer can support movements of the right to repair, ask a local repair shop how they can help, and use this to be more conscious about purchase decisions made every day.

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google just announced their new A-Series Pixel, and it's taking the concept behind the iPhone SE to the extreme. The Pixel 6a will be rocking the full Google Tensor chip, without the major hardware flaws of the SE, and for nearly the same price! So what's the catch? Well, the problem with the Pixel 6a isn't actually the phone itself, it's its big brother, the Pixel 6. The Pixel 6 only costs $600, so are there few enough compromises to justify spending that $150 less?</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/12/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-sensor-anim.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right off the bat, the 6a has a better fingerprint scanner (according to the leaks from Google themselves).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6a-unboxing-video-shows-fingerprint-scanner-not-slow/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android Police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This by itself may be a deal maker to some buyers. Unfortunately, not everything about the 6a can be praised. The screen is only 60hz while manufacturers like Samsung and OnePlus are giving their midrange competitors 120hz panels. The camera is also a disappointment, as unlike the previous A-Series, it doesn't keep the flagship setup, instead opting for the same cameras as the Pixel 5a. These downgrades are fair, seeing how Tensor exists, but again, $150. A feature people have always loved in the A-Series is the headphone jack, which the Pixel 6a omits. Another omission from last year's Pixel 5a is the charger in the box.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, the Pixel 6a is a solid midrange phone. The battery, like all of the A-Series, is supposed to be better than their flagship siblings (🙄), and it has a tried and true camera that has always managed to impress. Compared to the iPhone SE, it actually looks modern (like, come on Apple, the iPhone 8 is dead), so that's a plus. The 6a also will have an IP 67 rating (water resistant; up to one meter in water for 30 minutes) for the extra peace of mind. If you're looking for phones in that price range, the 6a is probably your best bet. It's not the best, but its software makes up for a lot of the downsides. If you can spring the extra $150, you probably won't regret splurging for its bigger sibling.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel?hl=en-US&amp;toggler1=Pixel+6&amp;toggler2=Pixel+6+Pro&amp;toggler0=Pixel+6a\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare the 6 and 6a</span></a></p>",

However, the Android Twelve update could have gone much better.<br>(Disclaimer: I am using a Galaxy S10e, my views are reflective of my experiences with these updates, and the flagship devices.)</p>\n<p>This story is the first ever Prism Exclusive! Please discuss in the comments.</p>\n<p><br>Android 12 Beta:<br>“On September 14, 2021, the One UI 4.0 Android 12 beta went live for the Galaxy S21 series in select markets. It was gradually rolled out in all supported markets. Samsung eventually opened up the beta to the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy Note 20 series.” (Quote: <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-12-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SamMobile</a>)<br>Initially, problems seemed to arise, Icon theming didn’t extend to google apps, and the Monet palettes generated were excessively vibrant compared to their google counterparts. These problems have not yet been resolved.<br><br>Good Lock:<br>Samsung’s semi-official tweaking hub “Good Lock”, received a multitude of updates for Android 12, most notably, the ability to import custom icon packs. However, this update poses potential legal issues, as refunded icon packs stay in the Good Lock app, available for use. On the good side of Good Lock, icon packs are finally available on the stock “One UI” launcher(albeit with the Good Lock app needed to be downloaded from the Galaxy Store), volume can be adjusted on an app-by-app basis, side-swipe gestures can perform a vast multitude of actions, the recents menu can be completely redesigned; and the keyboard’s colors, animations, and sounds can all be customized. All in all, the Good Lock app really completes the One UI experience.</p>\n<p>The Rollout:<br>The rollout of Android 12 and One UI 4.0 was a little shaky, but there were no major setbacks, and some devices got their update months ahead of schedule. The problem arises in the contents of the update. Kevin27 on the Samsung forum said “so I've just checked most of mine are using blue inside, which is the main color of my chosen pallette, I've found 2 using purple instead (which is one of the other 2 colors in my pallette) the Play Store is one, Google Clock app is the other - I don't know why these 2 are using purple instead of the blue.” This update left many people confused, so let’s explain what’s happening in the case of Kevin27. The One ui 4.0 theme selector shows 3 colors per Monet theme.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xs.png 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-sm.png 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-md.png 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/librewolf_VxpaZDHf1Z-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"80\"></figure>\n<p>The palettes being shown with this little amount of description leads to people not knowing what their own pallettes even mean. The main color of Kevin’s pallette was actually supposed to be purple, but with Samsung’s poor implementation of Monet, the apps that should be themed purple were left the default android 11 blue. As to my personal experiences, a Samsung support agent had the same problems as me, and could not provide a fix on this. What happened? To be honest, I really have no clue how Samsung’s implementation didn’t affect all of the android apps, however, I have heard from developers that there are multiple ways to implement monet into apps(and that they are all very convoluted), and it looks like whatever implementation the indie devs used worked a lot better than the Google implementation. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-xs.jpg 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-sm.jpg 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-md.jpg 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220209-211149_Firefox-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"A samsung support member reproducing the issue\" width=\"1080\" height=\"2280\"></figure>\n<p><br><br>The solution: <br>With One UI 4.1, Samsung seemingly fixed all these issues. The real question is what was wrong? All apps that support Monet theming do work(for me, at the time of writing); but the timeline it took to get there is very bumpy. On January 15th, I received the One UI 4.0 update, and it was not until March that my phone was supposed to get 4.1. To clarify, One UI 4.1 was part of the March security patch, and it started a slow release to the s10 lineup in (reportedly) March 28th. However, that was a Switzerland only release. On April 26th, it started a US release, on Unlocked phones only(which is odd, because usually carriers release their updates faster). On April 29th, nearly two months after \"March\", the rest of the s10 lineup was updated to One UI 4.1. The Galaxy A21 is still in the release phase of this update, nearly two and a half months later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-xs.jpg 300w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-sm.jpg 480w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-md.jpg 768w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://prism.ninja/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot_20220429-174512_System-updates-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"2280\"></figure>\n<p><br><br>The solution to the solution:<br>    Quite simply, Samsung has too many phones; from the A series to the Z series and S and M and W. And there are multiple phones in these lineups a year, and those phones have different models, and those different models use different carriers, and those different carriers can be in different regions that Samsung controls the updates for. The iPhone(no matter your or my opinion) is stable. With only one series a year (with the occasional SE), Apple can devote much more resources to developing good software for each device, and support them longer. If Samsung adopts a better phone tiering model, they might be able to prevent this from happening again.<br><br>Thinking about the future, Android 13 is supposed to add themed icons to all icons, (given that a developer provides a line art icon to their play store listing or apk) but Samsung’s themed icon aesthetic is not the same as Google’s; these clashing ideas may lead to a very poorly implemented design language in the future. Samsung claims to be supporting their new phones for even longer times, but until they clean up their act, this is bound to happen again.</p>",

Essentially, little signals are notification alerts that are designed to be as little of an intrusion into life as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>this is not on track to become an actual Made by Google product. (Source: 9to5Google),</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there are instructions to make your own DIY little signal, with the nest aesthetic with an arruino at the website: <a href=\"https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/</a></p>\n<p>What counts as an alert:</p>\n<div id=\"ips_uid_4232_2\" class=\"ipsSpoiler\" data-ipsspoiler=\"\">\n<div class=\"ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix\">\n<ul>\n<li>What seems to be a notification seems to be completely different from the types of notifications you might get on your phone, the example given in the documentation and supplied code are based on the environment, with possible triggers such as weather, rainfall, temperature, and other quantifiable alerts.</li>\n<li>Example (using the air little signal): the arduino pings the openweathermap.org api, and it says that it has begun raining, the air little signal sends a gust of air into the plant on top of it. You notice the plant move, and are prompted to open blinds, a phone, or more, to get more information. The end goal of this is to eliminate the need for a phone as a feed, and get all the alerts you need without thinking about it. </li>\n<li>Example 2 (using the movement little signal) (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my idea, and there are no official guides on making this trigger):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the arduino gets the forecast for the day (not putting an api because there is none listed officially), and the pegs move to see how the temp is throughout the day. These values would be arbitrary, but combined with another trigger to see the current temperature, you can see it all at a glance, without the tech being overtly visible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Meet the objects:</p>\n<div id=\"ips_uid_4232_3\" class=\"ipsSpoiler\" data-ipsspoiler=\"\">\n<div class=\"ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix\">Disclaimer: these are google’s unofficial mockups, the ones provided by their schematics are made with card stock. You might get varying degrees of success with a 3D printed chassis. <br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/XdSwhyFegF8\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Video by google</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"ipsSpoiler_contents ipsClearfix\"><figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-air.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-air.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure> <br><strong>Air</strong> interacts with its close surroundings. Pulses of air move nearby items, like the leaves of a plant, to attract attention.<figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-button.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-button.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure><br><strong>Button</strong> combines scale and sound to communicate and provide control. The top twists – right for more details, left for less – and grows as it receives information. It plays a tone when full.<figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-movement.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-movement.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure><br><strong>Movement</strong> features seven pegs that graphically represent information – like a calendar or timer– through their height and motion. The pegs work individually or as a group, and are tapped for simple input.<figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-rhythm.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-rhythm.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure><br><strong>Rhythm</strong> generates ambient sounds. Qualities of the melody convey qualities of the information, like its importance, urgency, or tone. A wave over the object, or simply turning it over, mutes it.<figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-shadow.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-shadow.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure><br><strong>Shadow</strong> communicates through the movements of the shadow it casts. They show the object’s status, like gently breathing when active or stretching in response to presence.<figure class=\"shrinkToFit\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-tap.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Google-Little-Signals-tap.png\" width=\"1536\" height=\"693\"></figure><br><strong>Tap</strong> makes use of surfaces to create sounds that act as notifications. A stronger tap means more pressing news.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>How to build your own Little Signals:</p>\n<p>You can build your own Little Signals by following the guide downloadable <a href=\"https://littlesignals.withgoogle.com/download/Experiment%20With%20Little%20Signals.zip\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a>, this guide requires an arduino, and has most of the objects made out of card stock, however, you can probably 3D print your own chassis for them(dont forget ventilation).</p>\n<p>Impact of this project:</p>\n<p>Google is showing increased interest in ambient computing, and with this being their first real project into it, it shows a glimpse into the future of the google ecosystem. My personal prediction is the eventual death of the phone as anything more than a content (games, videos, and art) creation and consuming facilitator, and work related facilities. But using the phone as a means of asking questions, checking your surroundings, and other things the google assistant can already do, will eventually fizzle away from the phone and be replaced by cues in your environment.</p>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/14/google-little-signals-experiment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9to5Google</a> for transcriptions of the google website &amp; quotes</p>\n</div>",
